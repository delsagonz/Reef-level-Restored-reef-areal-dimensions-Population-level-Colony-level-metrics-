Used for national fish and wildlife foundations (NFWF) report includes RRAD, eco footprint, abundance, area, mortality, and retention rates
# Restoration Results Section Final Graphs
This directory contains all R scripts used to generate final visualizations for Metric 3 and 4. Scripts are organized by workspace. Each folder includes the core plotting code and will indicate any subsequent files you need to load.

## ðŸ“Š Breakdown of Available Graphs

### **Ecological Footprint**

* **Histogram** comparing ecological footprints across all sites at pre- and post-outplant stages.

### **Brain + Star Abundance**

* **Line graph** showing change in abundance over time, including both *wild* and *restored* colonies.

### **Acropid Bleaching & Mortality**

* **Histogram** of recent mortality and bleaching prevalence across all sites at:

  * Immediate post-outplant
  * 3-month post-outplant

### **Acropid Abundance**

* **Line graph** similar to *Brain + Star Abundance*, but only for *Acropora cervicornis* (ACER) and *Acropora palmata* (APAL).

### **APAL Fragment Retention**

* **Histogram** showing:

  * Fragment loss
  * Fragment survival
  * Mortality outcomes

### **APAL Planar Area (Multiple Graphs)**

* **Boxplot** of APAL Mean TLE (Tissue Linear Extension) distribution per array at each timepoint
* **Bar graph** of Mean TLE Â± SE for restored planar area across sites and timepoints
* **Bar graph** of total restored surface area
* **Bar graph** of mean % change in live planar area over time
